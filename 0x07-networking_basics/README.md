Introduction

The SI Model, or the OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection model), is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe the functions of a networking system. It defines a hierarchical structure for the communication protocols used in telecommunication and computer networks.
Layers

The OSI Model consists of seven layers, each representing a different aspect of network communication. These layers are:

    Physical Layer
    Data Link Layer
    Network Layer
    Transport Layer
    Session Layer
    Presentation Layer
    Application Layer

Organization

The OSI Model is organized in a hierarchical manner, with each layer building upon the functionalities provided by the layers beneath it. This modular approach allows for easier implementation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of network systems.
LAN (Local Area Network)

A LAN is a network that spans a relatively small area, such as a single building or campus. It is typically used for connecting devices within a limited geographical area, such as an office or home network.
WAN (Wide Area Network)

A WAN is a network that covers a larger geographical area, often spanning multiple cities or even countries. It is used to connect LANs and other networks over long distances, typically through the use of leased lines or satellite links.
Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, allowing for the exchange of data and communication across the world.
IP Address

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
Types of IP Addresses

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical addresses, while IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal addresses, designed to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.
Localhost

Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, typically assigned the IP address 127.0.0.1. It allows a device to communicate with itself, useful for testing and troubleshooting network applications.
Subnet

A subnet is a subset of IP addresses within a larger network, typically used to divide a network into smaller, more manageable segments.
IPv6 Adoption

IPv6 was created to address the depletion of available IPv4 addresses and to provide additional features and improvements over IPv4, such as increased address space and better security.
TCP/UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the two main transport layer protocols used for data transmission over IP networks.
Difference between TCP and UDP

The main difference between TCP and UDP is the way they handle data transmission. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and flow control, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication without error correction or flow control.
Port

A port is a logical endpoint for communication in a network, identified by a numerical value. Ports are used to differentiate between different services or applications running on a single device.
SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers

    SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
    HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443

Network Connectivity Tool/Protocol

Ping is a commonly used tool/protocol to check if a device is connected to a network. It sends a small packet of data to a specific IP address and waits for a response, indicating whether the device is reachable.
