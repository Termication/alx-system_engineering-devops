## What Bash Scripting Should Not Be Used For

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automation and managing system tasks. However, it is not suitable for:

- Complex applications: Bash lacks the structure and features needed for large-scale software development.
- Performance-critical tasks: Scripting languages like Bash are slower compared to compiled languages.
- Cross-platform applications: Bash scripts are primarily used in Unix-like systems, limiting their portability.

## What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications use to request and exchange data.

## What is a REST API

A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that follows the principles of REST. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication and typically returns data in formats such as JSON or XML. REST APIs are stateless and can be easily scaled.

## What are Microservices

Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach enhances modularity, flexibility, and scalability.

## What is the CSV Format

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields separated by commas. CSV files are widely used for data exchange between applications.

## What is the JSON Format

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is built on two structures:

- A collection of name/value pairs (often called an object or a dictionary).
- An ordered list of values (often called an array).

## Pythonic Naming Conventions

### Pythonic Package and Module Name Style

- Package names should be short, all-lowercase, and preferably one word (e.g., `mypackage`).
- Module names should also be short, all-lowercase, and can use underscores if necessary for readability (e.g., `my_module`).

### Pythonic Class Name Style

- Class names should use the CapWords (CamelCase) convention (e.g., `MyClass`).

### Pythonic Variable Name Style

- Variable names should be in all-lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case) (e.g., `my_variable`).

### Pythonic Function Name Style

- Function names should be in all-lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case) (e.g., `my_function`).

### Pythonic Constant Name Style

- Constants should be in all-uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords (also known as CamelCase) is a naming convention where each word in the identifier starts with a capital letter without spaces or underscores. In Python, this convention is primarily used for naming classes. It enhances readability by clearly distinguishing class names from variables and functions, which typically use snake_case.
