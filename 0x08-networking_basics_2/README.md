**Networking README**

### **Localhost (127.0.0.1)**
Localhost, represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1, is a loopback network interface on a device. It allows the device to communicate with itself, often utilized for testing and troubleshooting network applications.

### **0.0.0.0**
0.0.0.0 is a special IP address commonly used to represent an invalid, unknown, or default target. In networking, it can indicate various meanings depending on the context, such as a default route, a wildcard address, or a non-routable address.

### **/etc/hosts**
The `/etc/hosts` file is a system configuration file found in Unix-like operating systems. It maps hostnames to IP addresses, allowing the system to resolve domain names locally without querying a DNS server. It is commonly used to override DNS entries or to define local network configurations.

### **Displaying Active Network Interfaces**
To display your machine's active network interfaces, you can use the following command:
```bash
ifconfig
