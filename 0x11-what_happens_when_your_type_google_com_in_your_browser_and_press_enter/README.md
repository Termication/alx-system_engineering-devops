What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a complex series of steps occurs behind the scenes to bring the requested webpage to your screen. This process involves several layers of the web stack, each working together seamlessly. Let's break down these steps:

1. DNS Request

When you enter https://www.google.com, the browser needs to translate this human-readable domain name into an IP address, which is necessary to locate the server hosting the website. This translation is done by the Domain Name System (DNS).

    Browser Cache: The browser first checks its cache to see if it has recently queried this domain and has the IP address stored.
    OS Cache: If the browser doesn't have the IP, it checks the operating system's cache.
    Router Cache: Next, it checks if the router has the IP address cached.
    ISP DNS: If all caches are empty, the request is sent to the ISP's DNS server.
    Recursive Search: If the ISP's DNS server doesn't have the IP, it performs a recursive search, querying other DNS servers until it finds the IP address for www.google.com.

2. TCP/IP Connection

Once the IP address is known, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server. This involves a three-step handshake:

    SYN: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to request a connection.
    SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet to acknowledge the request.
    ACK: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, establishing the connection.

3. Firewall

During this connection process, firewalls at various points (client-side, ISP, server-side) monitor the traffic to ensure that it is legitimate and not malicious. Firewalls help protect against unauthorized access and attacks.
4. HTTPS/SSL

Since the URL uses https, SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) is used to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. This involves:

    SSL Handshake: The browser and server exchange encryption keys and agree on encryption methods.
    Certificate Validation: The server presents its SSL certificate to the browser to prove its identity. The browser verifies this certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
    Session Encryption: Once the handshake is complete, a secure, encrypted communication channel is established.

5. Load Balancer

For large-scale websites like Google, incoming traffic is often distributed across multiple servers using a load balancer. The load balancer:

    Distributes Traffic: Directs the request to one of the available web servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
    Health Checks: Regularly checks the health of servers to ensure traffic is only sent to functioning servers.

6. Web Server

The web server receives the request and processes it. Common web servers include Apache, Nginx, and IIS. The web server:

    Handles Requests: Manages incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests.
    Static Content: Serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly to the client.
    Forwarding Requests: For dynamic content, forwards the request to the application server.

7. Application Server

The application server handles the logic of the application. It processes the request, interacts with databases, and executes application code. Common application servers include Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Spring.

    Request Processing: Executes the backend logic necessary to fulfill the request.
    Database Interaction: Queries the database for any required data.

8. Database

The database stores and retrieves data as requested by the application server. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Oracle.

    Query Execution: Executes SQL or NoSQL queries to fetch, insert, update, or delete data.
    Data Retrieval: Sends the requested data back to the application server.

Response

After processing the request, the application server sends the response back to the web server, which then sends it to the load balancer. The load balancer forwards the response to the client through the secure TCP/IP connection. The browser receives the response, processes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders the webpage for you to see.
Conclusion

Each of these components plays a crucial role in ensuring that when you type https://www.google.com and press Enter, the webpage loads quickly and securely. Understanding this process is essential for software engineers as it demonstrates a comprehensive knowledge of how web technologies work together.
