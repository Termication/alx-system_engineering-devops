# Overview

This project involves building a robust web stack using the sysadmin/devops track projects. The key objectives are to design a comprehensive diagram of the web stack, explain each component's functionality, discuss system redundancy, and understand crucial acronyms such as LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Diagram of the Web Stack

### Below is a diagram representing the web stack:

## Component Explanations

    Load Balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple web servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thus increasing reliability and availability.

    Web Servers (Apache): Serve the web content and handle client requests. Apache is a widely-used web server software that processes HTTP requests from clients.

    Database Servers (MySQL): Store and manage data for the web applications. MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS).

    Storage (NFS/S3): Provides persistent storage for static assets, backups, and other data. Network File System (NFS) or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) can be used depending on the setup requirements.

## System Redundancy

System redundancy is achieved by duplicating critical components of the web stack to prevent a single point of failure (SPOF). This includes:

    Load Balancers: Multiple load balancers can be set up to ensure traffic distribution continues if one fails.
    Web Servers: Multiple web servers ensure that if one server goes down, others can handle the traffic.
    Database Servers: Replication and clustering techniques ensure data availability and reliability.
    Storage: Redundant storage solutions like RAID, NFS mirroring, or S3 replication prevent data loss.

## Acronyms

    LAMP: Stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. It's a stack of open-source software used to run dynamic websites and servers.
    SPOF (Single Point of Failure): A part of the system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working.
    QPS (Queries Per Second): A measure of the number of queries handled by the server per second, indicating the server's performance under load.

### Setup and Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    ```sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```
### Install Dependencies:

    For Apache:

    ```sh

sudo apt-get install apache2
```
### For MySQL:

```sh

        sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```
    Configure Load Balancer:
        Install and configure HAProxy or Nginx for load balancing.

    Set Up Redundant Storage:
        Configure NFS or connect to S3.

    Deploy the Application:
        Deploy your web application code to the web servers.

### Usage

    Start the Services:

    ```sh

    sudo systemctl start apache2
    sudo systemctl start mysql
```
   ### Access the Application:
        Open your web browser and navigate to your load balancer's IP address or domain name.
